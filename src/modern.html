	<h1>The Internet Today</h1>
	  <p>The Internet has grown to spread it's roots across the most human aspects of life, influencing how we seek healthcare,
	  the dissemination and proliferation of the arts, and even setting up the first meeting between potential future spouses. Any
	  job, no matter how white collar, has been put at risk of replacement with the advancement of software, and blue collar jobs
	  have had one foot out the door since the developement of robotic arms beginning in the early 1960's.</p>
	
	<h2> The Early 2000's</h2>
	  <ul>
	    <li> Years: 1999-2000
	      <p> Wi-fi finally becomes standardized and consumers eat it up now that it ahs a catchy name and Apple decided to put
	      it in all their computers.
	      <p/>
	    </li>
	    <li> Year: 2000
	      <p> People of the industrialized world are beginning to become people of the informationalized world. Silliness is bound
	      to ensue, like that of the Y2K crisis, where people believed that computers wouldn't know to set the year position to
	      2001 rather than spout errors or go to 0. A worldwide simaltaneous computer crash was supposed to take place midnight 
	      New Year's Eve. This couldn't possibly ever happen, right? psh...
	      </p>
	    <li> Year: 2000
	     <p> The Nasdaq peaks at 5,132 points thanks to a steady diet of overvalaued web based companies and marks the last day
	     before the pop of the dot com bubble.
	     </p>
	    </li>
	    </li>
	    <li> Year: 2001
	      <p>The iPod releases and now Apple is in the public eye. Most behold this developement to be beautiful.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li> Years: 2000-2002
	      <p> The stock market crashes with investors losing about 5 trillion USD.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li> Year: 2002
	      <p> WorldCom files the third largest bankruptcy in US history, and the largest at it's time. A bunch of other
	      communication companies get flushed too.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li> Year: 2004
	      <p> 48% of dot com companies are actually still around? That's not bad...suck it Wall Street. And while eBay, Amazon,
	      and Google became moguls afterwards, a lot of little guys made it just fine.
	      </p>
	    <li>
